Title: Podcast Reviews App

Description:  This Podcast Reviews App was created for my Flatiron School Phase 4 Project.  This single page application is my first full-stack application.  This app uses a Flask API backend with a React frontend.  This app was developed using a many-to-many relationship.  Existing users can sign in and view their podcasts and profiles on their particular Podcasts with specific information on the podcast.  The existing user of the app can also edit the podcast information, delete a podcast, and view the podcast reviews for a particular Podcast.  They are also able to add a New Podcast to their Profile, and can separately add a Podcast Review to that Podcast.  Someone who wants to become a user for the app can create an account by clicking the Sign Up button on the Home page.

I faced some challenges creating this full-stack app when creating my backend routes that built on each other, viewing a user's podcasts, posting reviews to a particular podcast, and allowing a user to create an account to the Podcast App.

Prerequisites: This application requires the following installation into your terminal: npm install react-router-dom@6.  To run the client side front end you can do the following to get it to run in your terminal after forking and cloning into a folder on your computer:
In one terminal:
- cd podcast-app
- cd client (folder)
- npm start to run the React front-end

In the second terminal:
- cd podcast-app
- cd server (folder)
- type: python app.py to start the Flask API backend
